**Pathfinder**

A starter project for working with [EasyStar](https://github.com/prettymuchbryce/easystarjs)
pathfinding using tile-based worlds (edited using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)) inside Phaser.

Art assets from the following Kenney Asset packs: [Tiny Dungeon](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon)
and [Tiny Town](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-town), used with gratitude.
